### ðŸ”­ About me ðŸ”­

I am currently a professor at the [Federal University of CearÃ¡ (UFC)](https://www.ufc.br/), in Fortaleza, Brazil,
specialized in telecommunications. I received my Bachelor and Master of Science degrees from the same university in 2001
and 2003, respectively. In 1999, I studied for one year at the [Technische Universitaet Hamburg-Harburg
(TUHH)](https://www.tuhh.de/), in Hamburg, Germany as an exchange student funded by [German Academic Exchange Service
(DAAD)](https://www.daad.de/)/[Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel
(CAPES)](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br). From 2001 to 2004, I developed research activities by the [Wireless
Telecommunications Research Group (GTEL)](https://gtel.ufc.br/) of the [Teleinformatics Engineering Department
(DETI)](https://deti.ufc.br/) at UFC working in the areas of wireless communications, radio resource management, and
smart antennas. From 2005 to 2008, I did my Ph.D. studies by the [Communications Engineering
Lab](https://www.kt.tu-darmstadt.de/fachgebiet_kt/index.en.jsp) of the [Technische Universitaet Darmstadt
(TUD)](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/), in Darmstadt, Germany, in the same areas, with funding from DAAD/CAPES. During my
academic path, I also held scholarships from the [National Council for Scientific and Technological Development
(CNPq)](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br) and CAPES during my undergraduation course and from the [Ceara State Foundation
for Scientific and Technological Support (FUNCAP)](https://www.funcap.ce.gov.br/) during my M.Sc. course. In 2009, I got
approved in a public selection and became professor at UFC - Campus de Sobral, Sobral, where I for one year by the
Computer Engineering course. In 2010, I was approved in a new public selection as professor for the [Center of
Technology (CT)](https://ct.ufc.br/) for UFC - Campus do Pici, Fortaleza. Since 2015, I am with DETI where I am
currently Associate Professor II. I am also permanent member of the [Teleinformatics Engineering Post-Graduation Program
(PPGETI)](https://ppgeti.ufc.br/) at UFC and a researcher at GTEL, where I develop research activities related to 5th
and 6th generation wireless communication systems. My research interests include radio resource allocation, linear and
nonlinear optimization, signal processing, and machine learning.
